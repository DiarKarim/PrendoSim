PrendoSim is a robot gripper simulator that allows robotistics to do generate and test viable grasps using a novel grasp stability metric.

This simulator takes advantage of Unity's latest NVIDIA PhysX 4.1 integration to create physically realistic grasp simulations and outputs images in png format and joint pose data of the grippers digits and object's involved in json format.
